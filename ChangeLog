* 2.2.2 - Apr 25 2017
- Fix a race condition on some tasks that print an empty string as output

* 2.2.1 - Sep 27 2016
- Support literal "%s" and "%d" by using "%%s" or "%%d". Double-percents elsewhere will actually mean double-percent.
- Add docstrings, cleanups.

* 2.2.0 - Sep 26 2016
- Allow specifying "0" or "MAX" as the "concurrent tasks" parameter, to
execute all items given on the commandline at once (so num jobs = num items
provided).
- Update help message to read better, update READMEs.

* 2.1.1 - Sep 26 2016
- better handle un-decodable output on python3
- fix issue on python 3.5
- minor performance inprovements. 
- Terminate pipe if we hit a problem instead of hanging

* 2.1.0 - Sep 23 2016
- Forgot to release this
- Add "-nc" option for "no collate", where output will be given as soon as it is available, not upon task completion
- Some better handling of strings
- Flush stdout less often in no-collate case

* 2.0.1 - Jan 28 2016
- Fix race condition where occasionally really quick jobs would run but not
print the last job's result.
- Fix --version not displaying version

* 2.0.0 - Jan 27 2016
- Move stdout writing from a locked function within the context of the thread
running subprocess to its own thread. This allows the next process to get
started right away and not have to wait for the lock or stdout to flush. Good
performance increase here.
- Adjust timers to decrease sleep time
- Add __version__ and __version_tuple__ to disttask
- Support --help and --version
- Use a deque for better performance
- Support using "--" as the argset and reading items from stdin as alternative
to providing all items as arguments
- Cleanup READMEs somewhat

* 1.0 - Sometime 2011?
