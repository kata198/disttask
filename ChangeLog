*2.0.1 - Jan 28 2016
- Fix race condition where occasionally really quick jobs would run but not
print the last job's result.
- Fix --version not displaying version

* 2.0.0 - Jan 27 2016
- Move stdout writing from a locked function within the context of the thread
running subprocess to its own thread. This allows the next process to get
started right away and not have to wait for the lock or stdout to flush. Good
performance increase here.
- Adjust timers to decrease sleep time
- Add __version__ and __version_tuple__ to disttask
- Support --help and --version
- Use a deque for better performance
- Support using "--" as the argset and reading items from stdin as alternative
to providing all items as arguments
- Cleanup READMEs somewhat

* 1.0 - Sometime 2011?
